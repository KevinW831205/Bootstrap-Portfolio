                            <p> My name is Kevin Wang and I graduated Pennsylvania State University studying
                                Engineering Sciences, a multidisciplinary program in which student demonstrate their
                                knowledge in engineering through completing a capstone project. To which I am able to
                                combine
                                my interest in multiple subjects, especially electrical engineering and biomedicine, in
                                the
                                Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) lab. My group, which includes students in mechanical
                                and
                                biomedical engineering, uses MRI technology in study tissue stiffness, an indicator of
                                cancer and
                                other diseases. At Penn State I recieved a cross disciplinary education that allows me
                                to
                                enagage problem solving in a unique way.</p>
                            <p>Growing up I was immersed in multiple cultures. I was born in Taiwan but grew up in the
                                United States, China and Japan. In college I spent time studying abroad in Germany
                                where I
                                learned
                                the basics of production management and manufacturing, and experienced their culture. I
                                have a
                                diverse
                                cultural knowledge by living and studying in these different countries. </p>
                            <p>Currently I am studying some web development skills with UPenn's coding bootcamp. I am
                                learning HTML and CSS, and plan on obtaining more skills in the future 6 months. I plan
                                on
                                entering
                                the
                                programming industry and would like to incorporate my multidisciplinary and
                                cross-cultural
                                background
                                into my future work.</p>
